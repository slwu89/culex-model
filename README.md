# culex-model

A discretized stochastic and deterministic model of temperature and photoperiod driven culex dynamics with movement of adults based on the mathematical model presented in:

Paper: Uncovering mechanisms behind mosquito seasonality by integrating mathematical models and daily empirical population data: Culex pipiens in the UK [here](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-019-3321-2), Code repo: [here](https://github.com/davewi13/Mosquito-seasonality-paper)

Running this model requires [RcppArmadillo](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html) to be installed on the users machine.
